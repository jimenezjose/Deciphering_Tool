# Deciphering Tool
## Inspired by _Ghost In The Wires_ by Kevin Mitnick

At the beginning of every chapter of _Ghost in the Wires_, Mitnick proposes a cipher underneath the chapter header. 
This program is intended to be a tool to crack such ciphers; providing information such as character frequency, 
word count if the cipher contains space characters and alphabet shifts to crack Ceasar Ciphers. Currently I am working
on identifying reaccurring patterns characters in the cipher.
